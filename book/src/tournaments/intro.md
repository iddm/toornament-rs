# Tournaments

Tournaments is the basic entity of the API. Everything starts here, in tournaments. Each tournament
has matches, games, match results, participants, streams, videos, and so on. So the first thing we
should start learning is what is a **tournament** in terms of the service, how to create and edit
it.
